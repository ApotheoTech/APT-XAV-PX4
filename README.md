# Description

APT-XAV-PX4 is a PX4 based flight controller following FMUv5X. It has a SODIMM connector that is compatible with Nvidia's Jetson Nano, Xavier NX, and TX2 boards. It is a derivative of AntMicros' Jetson Nano Baseboard. I converted the board to Kicad using an Altium to Kicad converter available in the nightly builds of Kicad 6.0.

# Licensing

I was unsure how to license it based on AntMicro's Apache License. Due to recreating the work from Altium to Kicad, I was unable to preserve the "unmodified" files from the modified files. All modified files are released under the GPLV3 License.
