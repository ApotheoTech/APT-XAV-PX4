# Where to Buy

The prototypes for this board were not built due to a combination of a lack of funds, and a redirection of focus to another project February of 2021. If you are interested in supporting the project, or wish to create the prototypes, I have most of the BOM in stock.

# Licensing

I was unsure how to license it based on AntMicro's Apache License. Due to recreating the work from Altium to Kicad, I was unable to preserve the "unmodified" files from the modified files. All modified files are released under the GPLV3 License.
